# Work Effort System Test Issues

## Summary of Test Status
- Passing: 1 test (`test_02_creation_parameters.py`)
- Failing: 4 tests
- Total test duration: ~3 seconds

## Critical Issues to Fix

### API Parameter Mismatches
1. `WorkEffortManager.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'work_efforts_root'`
   - Occurs in: `test_05_error_handling.py` (Corrupt Index Recovery, Concurrent Updates)
   - Fix: Update test to use the correct parameter name or add support for the parameter in the implementation

2. `WorkEffortManager.filter_work_efforts() got an unexpected keyword argument 'content_contains'`
   - Occurs in: `test_04_filtering_and_querying.py` (Filter by Title/Content)
   - Fix: Add support for content filtering in the WorkEffortManager or update test to use supported parameters

### Validation Issues
1. Title validation isn't rejecting invalid characters
   - Occurs in: `test_05_error_handling.py` (Invalid Title)
   - Fix: Implement proper title validation to reject invalid characters like '/'

2. Priority validation doesn't reject invalid priorities
   - Occurs in: `test_05_error_handling.py` (Invalid Priority)
   - Fix: Implement proper priority validation

### Index Management Issues
1. Work Effort Manager isn't properly tracking created work efforts
   - Occurs in: `test_04_filtering_and_querying.py` (Filter by Status, Filter by Priority, Filter by Assignee)
   - Fix: Ensure work efforts are properly indexed and retrievable by filter criteria

### Timestamp Issues
1. Last updated timestamp not changing during status updates
   - Occurs in: `test_03_status_transitions.py` (Update Timestamp)
   - Fix: Ensure the last_updated timestamp is updated during status changes

## Medium Priority Issues
1. Due date filtering not working as expected
   - Occurs in: `test_04_filtering_and_querying.py` (Filter by Due Date)
   - Fix: Verify the due date filtering logic

## Low Priority Issues
1. Permission handling test warnings on macOS
   - Test shows warnings but still passes
   - Specific to operating system behavior

## Action Plan

1. Fix API parameter mismatches first (highest impact for passing tests)
2. Address validation issues
3. Fix index management issues
4. Address timestamp update issues
5. Fix filtering issues

## Manual Testing Approach
Until automated tests are passing, consider testing core functionality manually:

1. Create a work effort
2. Update its status
3. Verify folder structure and files
4. Verify index is updated correctly
