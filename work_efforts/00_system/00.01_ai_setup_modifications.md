## Objective
Update AI-Setup to create a "work_efforts" folder inside the .AI-Setup directory, include work effort scripts in the new folder structure, create a version bump (current version 0.2.3 â†’ 0.3.0), and update documentation to reflect the new structure.

## Tasks
- [x] Modify create_ai_setup() function to create a work_efforts folder
- [x] Update the setup_work_efforts_structure() function to support the new location
- [x] Copy work effort scripts to the new location
- [x] Update version numbers in __init__.py and setup.py
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with the new version information
- [x] Test the implementation

## Progress
- Successfully implemented the work_efforts directory inside the .AI-Setup folder
- Updated version to 0.3.0 across all relevant files
- Maintained backward compatibility with the root-level work_efforts directory
- Updated documentation to reflect the new structure
- Added code to copy scripts to both locations
- The setup_work_efforts_structure function now accepts an in_ai_setup parameter
- Tested implementation thoroughly and verified all components are created correctly

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring for any issues with the new structure
2. Consider future enhancements to the work efforts system

## Notes
- Current implementation creates work_efforts at the root level
- Need to maintain backward compatibility
- The .AI-Setup/work_efforts should include all subdirectories (templates, active, completed, archived, scripts)
- Implementation now creates work_efforts both at the root level (for backward compatibility) and inside .AI-Setup
