# Work Effort: Global CLI Setup & Folder Rename

## Status: Completed
**Started:** 2025-01-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27
**Johnny Decimal ID:** 00.03

## Objective
Make the CLI utility globally accessible from anywhere on the system and rename the .AI-Setup folder to .AI_setup (underscore instead of hyphen) for consistency.

## Tasks
1. [x] Rename all references from .AI-Setup to .AI_setup throughout codebase
2. [x] Check and update setup.py entry points for global CLI access
3. [x] Update installation instructions for global access
4. [x] Test global CLI functionality
5. [x] Update documentation to reflect new folder name
6. [x] Verify backward compatibility or migration path

## Progress
- ✅ Created this work effort to track the system changes needed
- ✅ Updated main CLI file (cli.py) with .AI_setup references
- ✅ Updated utils/directory_scanner.py with .AI_setup references
- ✅ Verified setup.py has correct entry points (code-conductor, cc-work-e)
- ✅ Successfully installed package globally with `pip install -e .`
- ✅ Tested global CLI access - `code-conductor setup` works from any directory
- ✅ Fixed duplicate folder issue - now only .AI_setup is created
- ✅ Verified all CLI commands work correctly (setup, list, work_effort)

## Implementation Results

### Global CLI Access ✅
- **Command**: `code-conductor` - available globally after `pip install -e .`
- **Secondary Command**: `cc-work-e` - enhanced work effort creator
- **Installation**: Works from any directory using standard pip installation
- **Entry Points**: Properly configured in setup.py

### Folder Rename ✅
- **Old**: `.AI-Setup` (with hyphen)
- **New**: `.AI_setup` (with underscore)
- **Status**: All core references updated in cli.py and utils/directory_scanner.py
- **Testing**: Verified only .AI_setup folder is created in new projects

### Johnny Decimal Integration ✅
- **Automatic**: New projects get Johnny Decimal structure automatically
- **Structure**: 00_system, 10_development, 20_debugging, 30_documentation, 40_testing, 50_maintenance
- **Index Files**: All 00.00_index.md files created with proper cross-references
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy directories (active, completed, archived) maintained

### Command Usage
```bash
# Global setup from any directory
code-conductor setup

# List work efforts
code-conductor list

# Create new work effort
code-conductor work_effort -i

# Enhanced work effort creator
cc-work-e -i
```

## Notes
- ✅ User can now run CLI utility from anywhere on system using `code-conductor` command
- ✅ Global installation working correctly via setup.py entry points
- ✅ Johnny Decimal structure automatically applies to new projects
- ✅ Fixed duplicate folder creation issue
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing work_efforts structure
