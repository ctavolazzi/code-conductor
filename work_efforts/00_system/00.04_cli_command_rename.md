# Work Effort: CLI Command Rename & Shorthand Commands

## Status: Completed ✅
**Started:** 2025-01-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27
**Johnny Decimal ID:** 00.04

## Objective
Rename the CLI command from `code-conductor` to something shorter, more memorable, and easier to type while maintaining clarity about its purpose. Add shorthand commands for even faster work effort creation.

## Decision: `cc-ai` ✅
**Selected**: `cc-ai` - Code Conductor AI
- **Length**: 5 characters
- **Pros**: Maintains branding, very short, memorable
- **Brand continuity**: Keeps "Code Conductor" identity
- **Easy to type**: Much more convenient than `code-conductor`

## Current vs New Commands
- **Old**: `code-conductor` (13 characters)
- **New**: `cc-ai` (5 characters) - 61% shorter!
- **Duplicates Removed**: `cc-work-e` eliminated for clarity

## Implementation Results

### ✅ Entry Points Updated
- **setup.py**: Changed from `"code-conductor=cli:main_entry"` to `"cc-ai=cli:main_entry"`
- **Removed**: `cc-work-e` entry point to eliminate confusion
- **Installation**: Tested via `pip install -e .`
- **Global Access**: Command works from any directory

### ✅ Help Text Updated
All help text and documentation updated throughout cli.py:
- Setup instructions
- Work effort system documentation
- Validation instructions
- Command help output
- Error messages and user guidance

### ✅ Testing Completed
- **Command Works**: `cc-ai setup`, `cc-ai list`, `cc-ai help` all functional
- **Structure Creation**: Johnny Decimal + .AI_setup folder created correctly
- **Help Text**: Shows correct command names throughout
- **No Duplicates**: `cc-work-e` command successfully removed

### ✅ Shorthand Commands Implemented
**Goal**: Make `cc-ai we` work as ultra-short work effort creation

#### Implemented Shorthand Commands
- ✅ `cc-ai wei` → equivalent to `cc-ai work_effort -i` (interactive work effort)
- ✅ `cc-ai we` → equivalent to `cc-ai work_effort` (non-interactive work effort)
- ✅ `cc-ai l` → equivalent to `cc-ai list`
- ✅ `cc-ai s` → equivalent to `cc-ai setup`

#### Implementation Details
- ✅ Added shorthand command parsing to main CLI parser
- ✅ Updated argument handling to recognize shorthand commands
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Changed from `we`/`w` to `wei`/`we` for better clarity
- ✅ Tested all shorthand functionality successfully in AI_setup project
- ✅ Updated help text to show shorthand options
- ✅ Updated documentation with new shorthand usage

## Implementation Tasks
1. [x] Decide on final command name - `cc-ai`
2. [x] Rename existing .AI-Setup folder in project root to .AI_setup
3. [x] Update setup.py entry points
4. [x] Test new command functionality
5. [x] Update all documentation and help text
6. [x] Update work effort tracking
7. [x] **NEW**: Implement shorthand commands (we, w, l, s)
8. [x] **NEW**: Test shorthand functionality
9. [x] **NEW**: Update documentation with shorthand usage
10. [x] **NEW**: Remove duplicate commands (cc-work-e)
11. [x] **NEW**: Clean up all references to removed commands

## Final Command Usage
```bash
# Full commands
cc-ai setup          # Setup .AI_setup and work_efforts structure
cc-ai list           # List work efforts
cc-ai work_effort -i # Create work effort interactively
cc-ai work_effort    # Create work effort non-interactively
cc-ai help           # Show all available commands
cc-ai version        # Show version

# Shorthand commands (UPDATED!)
cc-ai wei            # Work effort interactive (same as work_effort -i)
cc-ai we             # Work effort non-interactive (same as work_effort)
cc-ai l              # List (same as list)
cc-ai s              # Setup (same as setup)
```

## Benefits Achieved
- **61% shorter** to type than `code-conductor`
