# Enhanced Workflow Runner

## 🚩 Objectives
- Update the workflow_runner.py script to use the official template file for work efforts
- Add status management functionality for moving work efforts between directories
- Enhance the overall integration with the existing codebase
- Improve documentation and error handling

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Update the script to use the official template file from the templates directory
- [x] Add functionality to move work efforts between active, completed, and archived directories
- [x] Enhance the workflow_runner.py to handle additional metadata fields
- [x] Create status management test script
- [x] Document the enhancements and update the workflow process

## 📝 Notes
- The workflow_runner.py script now uses the template file from `.AI-Setup/work_efforts/templates/work-effort-template.md`
- If the template file doesn't exist, the script creates a default template
- The script supports full status management (active, completed, archived, paused)
- Files are automatically moved to the appropriate directory when their status changes
- Added support for more metadata fields like assignee, due date, and last updated

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- The default template had to handle multiple frontmatter fields that weren't in the hardcoded template
- Moving files between directories required careful handling to avoid loss of data
- Status updating required regex pattern matching to update the frontmatter

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- The workflow_runner.py script is now fully integrated with the project structure
- It uses the same template file as other scripts in the codebase
- Status management allows for proper lifecycle tracking of work efforts
- The directory structure is maintained correctly as work efforts change status
- All standard metadata fields are supported in the work effort documents
