## Objectives
- Integrate the Work Effort Manager into the system instead of using ai_work_effort_creator.py only
- Create a config.json file in .AI-Setup folder to configure the system
- Ensure all components properly use the Work Effort Manager when specified in config

## Tasks
- [x] Create config.json in .AI-Setup folder with work effort manager configuration
- [x] Modify cli.py to check for config.json and use WorkEffortManager when specified
- [x] Update run_work_effort_manager.py to load and use the config.json file
- [x] Create tests to verify that the integration works correctly
- [ ] Verify that the WorkEffortManager is properly used by the AI setup process
- [ ] Add documentation about the new configuration system

## Implementation Details
The implementation involved several key components:

1. **Configuration File (.AI-Setup/config.json)**
   - Created a config.json file in the .AI-Setup folder
   - Configured it to use the work effort manager
   - Specified paths to scripts and default settings

2. **CLI Integration (cli.py)**
   - Added a load_config function to read the config.json file
   - Created a setup_work_effort_manager_path function to ensure proper imports
   - Modified create_work_effort to check the config and use the manager when specified
   - Added auto-start functionality to start the manager in the background

3. **Work Effort Manager Updates (run_work_effort_manager.py)**
   - Modified to check for and load config.json
   - Updated to use configuration for manager initialization
   - Simplified the script to focus on its primary responsibilities

4. **Testing**
   - Created Python unit tests to verify the integration
   - Added a shell script to test the functionality end-to-end
   - Implemented tests for config loading, manager usage, and work effort creation

## Notes
- The work effort manager provides more comprehensive features compared to the ai_work_effort_creator.py script
- The configuration approach allows for flexible deployment across different environments
- The system falls back to the default implementation if the manager is not available or not enabled
- Tests ensure that the integration works properly and continues to work in the future
