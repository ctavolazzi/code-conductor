# Install package and create default work effort

## 🚩 Objectives
- Install the Code Conductor package locally in development mode
- Create a new default work effort using the installed package
- Verify all components are working correctly

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Install the package using pip install -e .
- [x] Verify the installation by checking available commands
- [x] Create a new default work effort using cc-work-e
- [x] Verify the work effort was created successfully

## 📝 Notes
- The package should be installed in development mode to test local changes
- We'll use the cc-work-e command which is the shorthand for creating work efforts
- Work efforts are created in a default location at `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/ai_setup/work_efforts/active/`
- The code actually does have `--current-dir` and `--package-dir` flags in the implementation (in the `parse_arguments` function), but they are not documented in the help output

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- The cc-work-e command's help documentation doesn't show the `--current-dir` flag, even though it's implemented in the code
- When trying to use `--use-current-dir`, the command throws an error saying the argument is unrecognized
- There's a discrepancy between the argument name in the code (`--current-dir`) and what was attempted in testing (`--use-current-dir`)
- The help output doesn't reflect all available options, making some features undiscoverable

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Successfully installed the package in development mode
- Verified that the commands are available in the PATH
- Created two work efforts with the cc-work-e command:
  - A default work effort titled "Untitled"
  - A work effort with a custom title "Created from installed package"
- Both work efforts were created in the default location at `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/ai_setup/work_efforts/active/`
- Discovered that the `--current-dir` flag exists in the code but is not documented in the help output
