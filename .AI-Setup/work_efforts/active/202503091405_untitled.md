# Help Message Enhancement

## 🚩 Objectives
- Improve the help message for code-conductor to show all available options
- Ensure users can easily understand how to use the tool properly
- Document all commands and options in a clear, accessible format

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Research all available commands and options in the codebase
- [x] Update the help message in `cli.py` to include all options
- [x] Update the `show_instructions()` function to provide better instructions
- [x] Test the enhanced help message with `code-conductor help`
- [ ] Consider adding this information to the README.md for future reference

## 📝 Notes
- The original help message was missing several commands and options
- Enhanced both help message implementations:
  1. The main `help` command output (`code-conductor help`)
  2. The `show_instructions()` function output
- Added documentation for the shorthand `cc-work-e` command and its options
- Added detailed parameter information for all commands
- Fixed formatting to make the help more readable and consistent

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- None significant; the code was well-structured and easy to modify

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- More comprehensive help message that shows all available commands and options
- Better documentation of command-line parameters and their default values
- Improved user experience through clearer instructions

## 📌 Linked Items
