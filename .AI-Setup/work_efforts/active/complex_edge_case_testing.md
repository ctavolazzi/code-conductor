# Complex Edge Case Testing for Work Effort Manager

## 🚩 Objectives
- Develop comprehensive edge case tests for the Work Effort Manager
- Identify potential failure points in the system
- Ensure robustness and reliability of the Work Effort Manager
- Test boundary conditions and error handling

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Create tests for invalid input data
- [x] Test file system edge cases (permissions, missing directories)
- [x] Test concurrency issues and race conditions
- [x] Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [x] Test with extremely large work efforts
- [x] Test internationalization and special character handling
- [x] Test with corrupted work effort files
- [x] Test performance under heavy load

## 📝 Notes
- Need to understand the full work effort manager implementation
- Will focus on edge cases not covered by existing tests
- Tests should be automated and repeatable

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- **Found multiple edge case issues:**
  1. The `create_work_effort` function doesn't properly validate empty strings for title
  2. `None` values for title causes an AttributeError when calling `.lower()`
  3. Extremely long titles create filenames that exceed the OS limit
  4. Special characters in titles lead to invalid filenames
  5. Invalid date formats are accepted without validation
  6. Missing directory structure isn't properly handled in all cases

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Created comprehensive test suite for edge cases
- Identified several important edge cases that need to be handled:
  1. Input validation for titles (empty strings, None values)
  2. Filename sanitization for special characters
  3. Title length truncation for extremely long titles
  4. Date format validation
  5. Better handling of missing directories
