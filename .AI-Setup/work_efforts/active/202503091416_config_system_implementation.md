# Config System Implementation

## üö© Objectives
- Implement a robust configuration system for code-conductor
- Clarify where work efforts are stored and how they're accessed
- Make it easier to use code-conductor in complex project structures
- Fix edge cases with work effort location and script installation
- Upgrade to version 0.4.3

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Create config.json storage system with defaults
- [x] Implement functions for creating, updating, and finding config
- [x] Update work effort discovery to use config-based paths
- [x] Add support for hierarchical config discovery
- [x] Fix bug with script installation during setup
- [x] Update help messages to accurately reflect work effort locations
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests for config system
- [x] Create shell script test to validate real-world behavior
- [x] Update version number to 0.4.3

## üìù Notes
- The configuration system uses a config.json file in the .AI-Setup directory
- Default configuration specifies work efforts should be in .AI-Setup/work_efforts
- Configuration is discovered by walking up the directory tree
- Scripts are correctly copied into the .AI-Setup/work_efforts/scripts directory
- Help messages have been updated to indicate work effort location

### Key Configuration Features
1. **Project Root Identification**: Config stores the project root path
2. **Work Effort Location Preference**: Can be set to "in_ai_setup" or "in_root"
3. **Manager Scripts Location**: Points to necessary scripts
4. **Hierarchical Discovery**: Finds the nearest config when run from subdirectories
5. **Default Settings**: Provides project-specific defaults for work efforts

### Configuration File Structure
```json
{
  "version": "0.4.3",
  "project_root": "/path/to/project",
  "created_at": "2025-03-09 14:16:00",
  "updated_at": "2025-03-09 14:16:00",
  "work_efforts": {
    "location": "in_ai_setup",
    "use_manager": true,
    "manager_script": "/path/to/scripts/work_effort_manager.py",
    "runner_script": "/path/to/scripts/run_work_effort_manager.py",
    "auto_start": true
  },
  "default_settings": {
    "assignee": "AI Assistant",
    "priority": "medium",
    "due_date": "+7d"
  }
}
```

## üêû Issues Encountered
- There was ambiguity about where work efforts should be stored
- When running from subdirectories, work efforts would be created in unexpected locations
- Script installation was not always copying all necessary files
- Version number needed to be updated across the project

## ‚úÖ Outcomes & Results
- Unambiguous work effort location based on configuration
- Consistent behavior when running from subdirectories
- All necessary scripts properly installed during setup
- Better user experience through clearer documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage for the configuration system
- Version updated to 0.4.3
