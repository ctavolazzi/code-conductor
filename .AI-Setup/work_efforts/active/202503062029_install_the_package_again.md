# Install the package again

## 🚩 Objectives
- Reinstall the AI-Setup package to version 0.2.0
- Verify all components are working correctly after reinstallation
- Document the installation process for future reference

## 🛠 Tasks
- [ ] Uninstall previous version of the package
- [ ] Install version 0.2.0 from the updated codebase
- [ ] Verify the work_effort command operates correctly
- [ ] Confirm AI content generation is explicitly opt-in (OFF by default)
- [ ] Test interactive mode with default values
- [ ] Update documentation if needed to reflect new features

## 📝 Notes
- Version 0.2.0 includes clearer messaging that AI content generation is OFF by default
- Updated command structure: "work_effort" is the new command for creating work effort files
- Project structure has been cleaned up (removed duplicate .AI-Setup directories)

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Previous unclear command naming led to confusion about functionality
- Interactive mode had issues with handling default values
- AI content generation was not explicitly marked as opt-in

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Improved CLI command structure with more intuitive naming
- Enhanced interactive experience with better explanations
- Clearer messaging that AI content generation is OFF by default
- More robust project structure with unnecessary duplicates removed
