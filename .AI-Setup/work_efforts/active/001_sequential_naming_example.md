# Sequential Naming Example

## 🚩 Objectives
- Demonstrate sequential numbering naming convention (001, 002, etc.)
- Document pros and cons of this approach

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Create example with sequential naming
- [x] Add to main work effort documentation

## 📝 Notes
- This convention uses a sequential number prefix (e.g., 001, 002, 003)
- Good for small projects with a clear sequence
- Provides clear ordering and visibility of total work efforts

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- None

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- **Pros:**
  - Simple and easy to understand
  - Good for ordered/sequential workflows
  - Clear numbering helps with reference ("Work effort number 5")
  - Works well in sorted file listings
- **Cons:**
  - Requires manual tracking of last used number
  - Can get complex when inserting items between existing numbers
  - Doesn't provide timestamp information
  - Less suitable for parallel/unrelated work streams
