# Code Conductor v0.4.1

This is a bugfix release for Code Conductor that fixes the command names.

## What's Fixed in v0.4.1

- **Command Names Fixed**: The CLI commands now correctly use `code-conductor` and `code-work-effort` instead of the previous names
- **Package Structure**: Updated for better consistency with the new name

## Installation

```bash
pip install code-conductor
```

## Usage

```bash
# Set up AI assistance in the current directory
code-conductor setup

# Create a new work effort
code-conductor work_effort

# List all work efforts
code-conductor list

# Create a work effort interactively
code-work-effort -i

# Use AI to generate content for a work effort
code-work-effort --use-ai --description "Your description"
```

## Key Features
