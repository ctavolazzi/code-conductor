# Code Conductor v0.4.5

This release introduces a major enhancement to work effort management by implementing folder-based work efforts, making it easier to organize related files and maintain cleaner project structures.

## New Features

### Folder-Based Work Efforts
- Each work effort now creates a dedicated folder instead of a single file
- Main markdown work effort file is stored inside the folder
- Related files can be stored alongside the work effort markdown file
- Supports special characters and Unicode in folder names
- [Full documentation available](../../docs/folder_based_work_efforts.md)

### Migration & Backward Compatibility
- Added `convert_to_folders.py` utility to migrate existing work efforts to folders
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing file-based work efforts
- All command-line interfaces now consistently use the folder-based approach

## Technical Improvements

### Centralized Implementation
- Consolidated work effort creation logic in WorkEffortManager
- Updated all entry points to use the centralized implementation
- Added graceful fallbacks when WorkEffortManager isn't available

### Robust Testing
- Added test cases for special characters, Unicode, and long titles
- Verified file operations within work effort folders
- Ensured consistent behavior across different entry points

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed file locking issues during folder creation
- Improved filename sanitization for better compatibility
- Enhanced error handling during file operations

## Documentation
- Added comprehensive guide for folder-based work efforts
- Updated main README to highlight the new feature
- Added example use cases and code snippets
