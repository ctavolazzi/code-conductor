- **Event-Based Architecture**: Background monitoring of work effort changes with customizable event handlers
- **JSON Integration**: Comprehensive support for JSON input/output, configuration, and work effort creation
- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting**: Powerful filtering system to find work efforts by status, assignee, priority, dates, and more
- **Convenience Methods**: Easy retrieval of active, recent, overdue, and assignee-specific work efforts

# Set up AI assistance in the current directory
code-conductor setup

# Create a new work effort
code-conductor work_effort

# List all work efforts
code-conductor list

# Create a work effort interactively
cc-work-e -i

# Use AI to generate content for a work effort
cc-work-e --use-ai --description "Your description"

# Create a default work effort in current directory
cc-work-e

# List active work efforts
cc-work-e --list-active

# List recent work efforts from the last 7 days
cc-work-e --list-recent 7

# List overdue work efforts
cc-work-e --list-overdue

# List work efforts assigned to a specific person
cc-work-e --list-by-assignee --assignee "developer"

# Filter by priority and sort by due date
cc-work-e --list-active --priority "high" --sort-by "due_date"

# Create a work effort from JSON
cc-work-e --json-string '{"title": "New Feature", "assignee": "developer", "priority": "high", "due_date": "2025-03-30"}'
```

## Key Features

- **AI Development Environment**: Set up standardized environments for AI-assisted development
- **Project Templates**: Maintain consistent project structures across your AI development work
- **CLI Tools**: Intuitive command-line interface for all core functionality
- **Simplified Workflow**: Create work efforts in your current directory with a single command

- **Event-Based Architecture**: Monitor changes and perform automated actions when work efforts change
- **JSON Support**: Create and manage work efforts programmatically with JSON

## For Developers

The new WorkEffortManager provides a clean API for programmatic work effort management:

```python
from work_efforts.scripts.work_effort_manager import WorkEffortManager

# Initialize the manager
manager = WorkEffortManager(project_dir="/path/to/project")

# Check if the required folders exist
if manager.has_required_folders():
    # Get active work efforts
    active_work_efforts = manager.get_active_work_efforts()

    # Get work efforts assigned to a specific person
    user_work_efforts = manager.get_work_efforts_by_assignee("developer")

    # Get overdue work efforts
    overdue_work_efforts = manager.get_overdue_work_efforts()

    # Create a work effort from JSON
    manager.create_work_effort_from_json({
        "title": "New Feature",
        "assignee": "developer",
        "priority": "high",
        "due_date": "2025-03-30",
        "content": {
            "objectives": ["Implement new feature", "Write tests"],
            "tasks": ["Design API", "Implement core functionality", "Test edge cases"]
        }
    })
```
