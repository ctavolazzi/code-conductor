# Work Effort Manager Implementation

## üö© Objectives
- Create a new `WorkEffortManager` class to centralize operations across the project
- Implement an event loop in the `WorkEffortManager` to handle project operations
- Update the codebase to use the new `WorkEffortManager` for v0.4.2
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing work effort functionality
- Add validation to check for work_efforts and _AI-Setup folders before creating work efforts
- Add JSON input/output capabilities for greater versatility
- Implement advanced filtering and sorting of work efforts

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Design the `WorkEffortManager` class structure
- [x] Implement the `WorkEffortManager` class with appropriate methods
- [x] Create an event loop to handle project operations
- [x] Add functionality to instantiate and run the WorkEffortManager
- [x] Add validation for required folders (work_efforts and _AI-Setup)
- [x] Implement JSON processing capabilities
- [x] Add advanced filtering and sorting of work efforts
- [ ] Write tests for the new functionality
- [x] Update documentation
- [ ] Include the feature in v0.4.2 release

## üìù Notes
- The `WorkEffortManager` will centralize operations across the project
- It needs to be designed to be instantiated as a Python class
- Should integrate with existing work effort scripts and functionality
- Will be part of the v0.4.2 release
- Implemented with a robust event system for extensibility
- Includes file system monitoring for work effort changes
- Provides a clean API for creating and managing work efforts
- Added validation to check for both work_efforts and _AI-Setup folders
- The manager will only create work efforts if both required folders are present
- JSON processing added for configuration and work effort creation
- Can accept configuration via JSON string, file, or dictionary
- Supports creating work efforts from JSON data in various formats
- Advanced filtering allows searching by status, assignee, priority, dates, and more
- Sorting options include by creation date, due date, priority, and title
- Convenience methods for common queries (active, recent, overdue, by assignee)

## üêû Issues Encountered
- No issues encountered during implementation

## ‚úÖ Outcomes & Results
- Created WorkEffortManager class in work_efforts/scripts/work_effort_manager.py
- Created a script to run the WorkEffortManager in work_efforts/scripts/run_work_effort_manager.py
- Implemented an event loop that monitors the work efforts directories
- Added handlers for work effort creation, updates, and status changes
- Created a straightforward API for managing work efforts programmatically
- Added validation to check for required folders before creating work efforts
- Modified the manager to only proceed if both work_efforts and _AI-Setup folders exist
- Added comprehensive JSON handling for flexible integration
- Implemented methods to parse JSON from strings, files, and dictionaries
- Created dedicated method for creating work efforts directly from JSON data
- Implemented powerful filtering system for retrieving work efforts by various criteria
- Added convenience methods for common work effort queries
- Improved CLI to support listing work efforts with different filtering options
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with the new features
- Enhanced v0.4.2 release notes with detailed information about the WorkEffortManager
