# Obsidian-Style Document Linking

## 🚩 Objectives
- Implement Obsidian-style wiki links between work effort documents
- Add support for related_efforts field in frontmatter
- Ensure proper parsing and rendering of [[wiki-style]] links throughout documents
- Update templates and documentation to reflect new linking capabilities

## 🛠 Tasks
- [ ] Modify `WorkEffort` class to add related_efforts field
- [ ] Update `to_markdown` method to include related_efforts in frontmatter
- [ ] Update `from_markdown` method to parse related_efforts from frontmatter
- [ ] Add support for recognizing [[wiki-style]] links in document content
- [ ] Update work effort template to include related_efforts field
- [ ] Create documentation for how to use document linking
- [ ] Add tools to find and suggest related work efforts

## 📝 Notes
- Obsidian uses double bracket syntax for wiki links: [[Document Name]]
- Links should work in both frontmatter (structured) and free text (unstructured)
- Should support linking to existing work efforts by title or filename
- Should validate links where possible and provide warnings for broken links
