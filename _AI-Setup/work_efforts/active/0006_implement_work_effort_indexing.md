# Implement Work Effort Indexing

## Overview

This feature adds a comprehensive indexing system for work efforts that can scan an entire project for work efforts regardless of their location. The indexing system uses advanced pattern matching and content analysis to find all work efforts across the project, even if they're misnamed or in unexpected locations, and creates a structured representation for easy access and tracking.

## Implementation Details

- Added `index_all_work_efforts` method to `WorkEffortManager` class with thorough search capabilities
- Created a command-line script for accessing the indexing functionality
- Implemented recursive directory scanning to find all work efforts
- Added multiple pattern matching strategies:
  - Filename pattern matching (sequential, date-prefixed, timestamps)
  - Directory structure recognition (work_efforts, active, etc.)
  - Content-based identification (frontmatter, markdown sections)
- Included metadata extraction and standardization for consistent representation
- Implemented sorting by modified date for relevance
- Added filtering capabilities in command-line tool
- Improved output formatting and summary statistics
- Registered the script as a console entry point in setup.py (`cc-index`)

## Key Features

1. **Project-Wide Discovery** - Recursively finds all work efforts, regardless of where they're stored
2. **Comprehensive Pattern Matching** - Identifies work efforts through multiple methods:
   - Standard naming patterns (0001_, 202303170001_, etc.)
   - Work effort keywords in filenames (work_effort, task, feature, etc.)
   - Directory structure hints (work_efforts folder, active/completed, etc.)
   - Content-based detection with frontmatter and markdown analysis
3. **Smart Directory Recognition** - Understands diverse folder structures beyond just "work_efforts" and "_AI-Setup"
4. **Status Detection** - Extracts status from both content and directory structure
5. **Rich Output Options** - Tabular or JSON output formats with extensive filtering options
6. **Detailed Summary Statistics** - Provides comprehensive statistics about work effort distribution

## Usage

### Python API

```python
from code_conductor.manager import WorkEffortManager

# Initialize the manager
manager = WorkEffortManager()

# Basic indexing - standard search
work_efforts = manager.index_all_work_efforts()

# Thorough search for misnamed or non-standard work efforts
work_efforts = manager.index_all_work_efforts(aggressive_search=True)
```

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage - scan current directory and display as table
python src/code_conductor/scripts/index_work_efforts.py

# Using the installed console script
cc-index

# Thorough search to find all possible work efforts (slower but more comprehensive)
cc-index --thorough

# Simple search (faster but less comprehensive)
cc-index --simple

# Filter results by text in title or content
cc-index --filter "authentication"

# Show summary statistics
cc-index --summary

# Output as JSON
cc-index --format json

# Skip saving index file
cc-index --no-save
```

## Files Modified/Created

- `src/code_conductor/manager.py` - Enhanced `index_all_work_efforts` method with comprehensive search
- `src/code_conductor/scripts/index_work_efforts.py` - Updated command-line interface with new options
- `setup.py` - Added entry point for the index script

## Testing

The enhanced work effort indexing feature has been thoroughly tested with the following results:
- Successfully indexed 222 work efforts across the entire project
- Found work efforts in various locations including standard work_efforts directories, _AI-Setup, and multiple demo directories
- Correctly identified all work effort formats (sequential, timestamps, date-based, etc.)
- Successfully extracted and normalized metadata from diverse sources
- Generated a complete JSON representation of all work efforts with their metadata
- Produced clear summary statistics about work effort distribution
- Handled edge cases like special characters, Unicode, and non-standard naming

## Performance

The indexing process is quick and efficient:
- Recursively scanned the entire project directory structure
- Applied multiple pattern matching strategies in a single pass
- Generated a comprehensive JSON index file (31KB) containing all work efforts
- Produced a formatted table of results with proper alignment and truncation

## Future Improvements

- Add ability to output the index in different formats (CSV, HTML)
- Implement cache to speed up subsequent scans
- Add visualization of work effort network/relationships
- Expose the indexed data via API for integration with other tools
- Create a web interface for browsing and managing work efforts
- Add full-text search capabilities within work effort content
