# Test v0.4.1 Package Installation

## 🚩 Objectives
- Install the code-conductor v0.4.1 package in a new test repository
- Test the CLI commands and verify they work as expected
- Document any issues or behavior differences from expected

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Create a new test repository locally
- [x] Install code-conductor using pip
- [x] Test the `code-conductor setup` command
- [x] Test the `cc-worke` command for work effort creation
- [x] Test other CLI commands from the release notes
- [x] Verify all features mentioned in the release notes

## 📝 Notes
- Release notes indicate that command names have been improved
- Default work effort creation is a new feature
- The package structure has been updated for better consistency
- Issues found led to the creation of v0.4.2 to fix the command naming inconsistency

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- The `cc-worke` command mentioned in the release notes is actually `cc-work-e` (with a hyphen)
- There appears to be a typo in the release notes where it refers to `cc-worke` instead of `cc-work-e`
- The command creates work efforts in `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/ai_setup/work_efforts/` rather than in the current directory

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Successfully installed code-conductor v0.4.1
- The `code-conductor setup` command works as expected
- The `cc-work-e` command (not `cc-worke` as in the release notes) works to create work efforts
- The `code-conductor work_effort` command works and creates a default work effort
- The `code-conductor list` command works and displays the work efforts
- The interactive mode with `cc-work-e -i` works correctly
- Created v0.4.2 release to fix naming inconsistency between the entry point and installed command
- Updated documentation to use the correct command name consistently
