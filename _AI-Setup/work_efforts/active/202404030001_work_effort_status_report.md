# Work Effort Status Report Script

## 🚩 Objectives
- Create a Python script to scan all existing work efforts and generate a comprehensive status report
- The script should analyze work efforts in active, completed, and archived directories
- Generate summary statistics and detailed reports of all work efforts
- Provide sorting and filtering options for the report

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Design the script structure and requirements
- [x] Create a function to find and read all work effort files
- [x] Build a parser to extract metadata and content from work efforts
- [x] Implement report generation functionality
- [x] Add command-line arguments for filtering and customizing reports
- [x] Create HTML and markdown export options
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [x] Document usage instructions

## 📝 Notes
- Will use existing WorkEffortManager functionality for retrieving work efforts
- The report should include statistics like total count, status distribution, priority distribution, etc.
- Will need to account for potentially malformed or incomplete work effort files
- Consider adding time-based metrics (average completion time, time in active status, etc.)
- The script is implemented in `status_report.py` with documentation in `README.md`
- Supports multiple output formats: text, markdown, HTML, JSON, and CSV
- Provides detailed statistics including completion rates and average completion times
- Initial testing shows the script works correctly, identifying 76 work efforts in the project
- Some work efforts have inconsistent metadata formatting, which the script handles gracefully with warnings

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Had to handle parsing of YAML-like metadata from work effort markdown files
- Needed to ensure proper escaping for CSV format
- Ensured imports work correctly whether running from project root or script directory

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Created a comprehensive status report generator that can work with any project using the work effort format
- The script generates detailed reports with statistics and work effort details
- Provides multiple output formats for different use cases (text for console, HTML for viewing, CSV for data analysis)
- Documentation and examples included for easy onboarding
