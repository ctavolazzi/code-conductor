# Project Manifest Implementation

## üö© Objectives
- Create a project manifest file to serve as an anchor point for identifying the project root directory
- Modify the configuration discovery process to utilize the manifest file
- Ensure that the system can locate the project configuration even from deeply nested directories
- Create a breadcrumb trail of reference files to help users navigate back to the project root
- Add a command to help users find their way back to the project root from any subdirectory

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Add code to create a `.code-conductor` manifest file in the project root during setup
- [x] Modify the `find_nearest_config` function to first look for the manifest file
- [x] Update the config discovery logic to use the manifest file's information
- [x] Create a function to generate `.code-conductor-ref` files in each directory where commands are run
- [x] Implement a `find-root` command to help users navigate back to the project root
- [x] Test the implementation in a fresh directory
- [x] Verify that the system can locate the configuration from nested directories
- [x] Confirm that breadcrumb references are created and can be used to find the project root

## üìù Notes
- The implementation adds two types of files:
  1. A `.code-conductor` manifest file in the project root directory containing:
     - `project_root`: Absolute path to the project root
     - `version`: Current version of code-conductor
     - `created_at`: Timestamp of when setup was performed
     - `setup_path`: Path to the _AI-Setup directory
  2. A `.code-conductor-ref` reference file in each directory where commands are run, containing:
     - Command history with timestamps
     - Paths back to the project root
     - Relative paths from the project root
     - References to the manifest file

## üêû Issues Encountered
- None significant

## ‚úÖ Outcomes & Results
- Successfully implemented the project manifest file creation during the setup process
- Added directory reference files that create a breadcrumb trail throughout the project
- Created a `find-root` command that helps users quickly locate and navigate to their project root
- Modified the configuration discovery process to first look for the manifest file
- Confirmed that the system can now reliably locate the project configuration from any subdirectory
- Added appropriate error handling for cases where the manifest file might be corrupted or invalid
- Each directory where commands are run now contains a history of commands with timestamps and path information
