# Implement Work Effort Tracing

## üö© Objectives
- [x] Add tracing capabilities to easily find and resume work efforts
- [x] Implement a robust system for tracking work effort relationships
- [x] Create a clean interface for querying work effort history
- [x] Ensure proper integration with existing work effort management

## üõ† Tasks
- [x] Design the tracing data structure
- [x] Implement tracing methods in WorkEffortManager
- [x] Add CLI commands for tracing operations
- [x] Create tests for tracing functionality
- [x] Update documentation with tracing features

## üìù Notes
- Tracing should support finding related work efforts
- Need to track work effort history and relationships
- Should integrate with existing indexing system
- Must maintain backward compatibility

## üêû Issues Encountered
- Import issues when testing the WorkEffortManager implementation:
  - The system had duplicate implementations in both `manager.py` and `work_effort_manager.py`
  - The `__init__.py` file was incorrectly importing from `.work_effort_manager` but needed to import from `.manager`
  - A root-level `__init__.py` file was causing Python's import system to resolve to the wrong module
  - Fixed by updating the imports in `src/code_conductor/__init__.py` and making test imports explicit with `from src.code_conductor import WorkEffortManager`

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [x] Can find related work efforts easily
- [x] Can trace work effort history
- [x] CLI commands work reliably
- [x] Tests pass with good coverage
- [x] Documentation is clear and complete

## üîÑ Implementation Summary

### Added Tracing Capabilities
1. **WorkEffortManager Methods**
   - `find_related_work_efforts()`: Find work efforts related to a given effort
   - `get_work_effort_history()`: Get history of status changes and updates
   - `trace_work_effort_chain()`: Trace dependencies between work efforts
   - Enhanced `update_work_effort_status()` to track history

2. **CLI Command**
   - Added `cc-trace` command with multiple modes:
     - `--related`: Find related work efforts
     - `--recursive`: Recursively find relations
     - `--history`: Show work effort history
     - `--chain`: Show dependency chain
     - `--format`: Choose output format (table/json)

3. **Testing**
   - Created comprehensive test suite
   - Tests cover all tracing functionality
   - Includes fixtures for sample work efforts
   - Verifies history tracking and relationships

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Find related work efforts
cc-trace "Work Effort Title" --related

# Show work effort history
cc-trace "Work Effort Title" --history

# Trace dependency chain
cc-trace "Work Effort Title" --chain

# Get JSON output
cc-trace "Work Effort Title" --related --format json
```

### Integration
- Registered `cc-trace` as a console script in setup.py
- Integrated with existing work effort management
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Uses existing indexing system
