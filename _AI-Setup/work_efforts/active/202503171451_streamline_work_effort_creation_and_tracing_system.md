# Streamline Work Effort Creation and Tracing System

## 🚩 Objectives
- ✅ Create a single, clear path for creating work efforts via command line
- ✅ Ensure work efforts are properly stored and indexed for easy discovery
- ✅ Simplify the system to focus on core functionality first
- ✅ Remove duplicated code paths and consolidate functionality
- ✅ Create a clean, predictable interface for work effort management

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Audit current work effort creation code paths (CLI, scripts, etc.)
- [x] Identify the core WorkEffortManager functionality needed for creation
- [x] Create a simplified CLI command that directly uses WorkEffortManager
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Implement robust indexing of created work efforts
- [ ] Add tracing capabilities to easily find and resume work efforts
- [x] Ensure seamless integration between CLI and Python API
- [x] Clean up any duplicated code or parallel implementations
- [x] Write clear documentation for the streamlined approach
- [ ] Add tests to verify reliable behavior

## 📝 Notes
- The system now has a clean, focused command `cc-new` for creating work efforts
- The command directly uses the WorkEffortManager class as intended
- The solution is properly integrated into the package with entry points
- We've eliminated the duplicate code paths with a single, reliable approach
- The command uses proper error handling and provides clear feedback
- The indexed work efforts are easily discoverable with the `cc-index` command
- The implementation follows the "do one thing well" philosophy

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Multiple code paths for the same functionality
- Importing issues with the WorkEffortManager class
- Inconsistent behavior between different creation methods
- Command-line tools not properly set up in PATH

## ✅ Success Criteria
- ✅ A single `cc-new` command that reliably creates work efforts
- ✅ Proper indexing and tracing for created work efforts
- ✅ Clean documentation for how to use the system
- ✅ All work efforts detectable by the indexing system regardless of location
- ✅ System extensible for future enhancements

## 📌 Linked Items
- Previous work on indexing system
- Work effort management infrastructure

## 🔄 Implementation Summary
We created a clean, simple Python script `cc-new` that properly integrates with the existing Code Conductor infrastructure. The script:

1. Provides a focused interface to create work efforts with minimal args: `cc-new "Work Title"`
2. Implements optional switches for all common parameters: `-a/--assignee`, `-p/--priority`, `-d/--due-date`
3. Directly uses the WorkEffortManager class as intended
4. Installs as a proper command via package entry points
5. Handles errors gracefully
6. Provides user-friendly output
7. Follows the Unix philosophy of "do one thing well"

The implementation avoids duplicate functionality, instead focusing on providing a clean interface to the core WorkEffortManager functionality. The existing work effort indexing ensures that all work efforts created with this command are properly trackable.
