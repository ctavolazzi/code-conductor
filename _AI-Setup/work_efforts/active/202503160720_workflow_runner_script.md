# Workflow Runner Script

## Overview

The Workflow Runner Script is an automated implementation of the Code Conductor workflow process. It guides users through each step of the development workflow, creating necessary files, documenting progress, and ensuring all documentation is properly updated.

## Goals

- Automate the complete workflow process defined in the workflow process document
- Provide interactive prompts to guide users through each step
- Generate consistent project files following best practices
- Ensure comprehensive documentation at each stage
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes

## Implementation Details

The script implements a complete workflow cycle:

1. **Creating Work Effort Document**
   - Generates a timestamped markdown file
   - Adds proper frontmatter with title, date, priority, status
   - Creates template sections for goals, requirements, etc.

2. **Adding Context & Requirements**
   - Prompts user to complete the document
   - Provides guidance on what to include

3. **Creating Script or Code**
   - Generates a well-structured Python script template
   - Includes proper docstrings, argument parsing, and main function
   - Makes the script executable

4. **Executing & Testing**
   - Runs the created script
   - Captures and displays output and errors
   - Reports success or failure

5. **Documenting Results**
   - Prompts for test results and observations
   - Updates the work effort document with results

6. **Refining Until Successful**
   - Guides the user through the iterative improvement process
   - Provides feedback on what to focus on

7. **Adding Tests**
   - Creates a test script template
   - Sets up unittest framework
   - Runs tests if requested

8. **Updating Documentation**
   - Updates CHANGELOG with new entries
   - Verifies all documentation is complete
   - Provides a documentation checklist

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode (default)
./workflow_runner.py

# Non-interactive mode with default values
./workflow_runner.py --non-interactive

# Specify feature name
./workflow_runner.py --feature-name "Enhanced Search Functionality"
```

## Technical Implementation

The script is built using several key components:

1. **WorkflowRunner Class**
   - Manages the entire workflow process
   - Handles file creation and execution
   - Provides interactive prompts

2. **Templates**
   - Work effort document template
   - Script template
   - Test template
   - Devlog entry template

3. **Documentation Integration**
   - Updates devlog with new entries
   - Adds CHANGELOG entries
   - Verifies documentation completeness

4. **File Utilities**
   - Generates consistent filenames
   - Creates executable scripts
   - Handles file reading and writing

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures all development follows the same process
- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks in the workflow
- **Documentation**: Guarantees comprehensive documentation
- **Onboarding**: Makes it easier for new team members to follow the workflow
- **Quality**: Enforces testing and validation steps

## Tests

Manual testing confirmed the script successfully:
- Creates properly formatted work effort documents
- Generates executable Python scripts
- Creates test files with unittest structure
- Updates devlog with new entries
- Runs scripts and tests and captures output
- Validates documentation completeness

## Conclusion

The Workflow Runner Script successfully automates the Code Conductor workflow process, making it easier for developers to follow best practices and ensure comprehensive documentation. This tool embodies the documentation-first development approach central to the Code Conductor philosophy.
