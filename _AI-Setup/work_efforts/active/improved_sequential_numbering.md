# Improved Sequential Work Effort Numbering

## Description

This work effort updates the counter system to use sequential numbers for work effort naming and adds support for handling numbers that exceed 9999.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. Updated the regex pattern to support variable-length numbers:
   - Old pattern: `r"^(\d{4})_"` (only matched 4-digit numbers)
   - New pattern: `r"^(\d+)_"` (matches any number at the start)

2. Added support for handling numbers beyond 9999:
   - Numbers 1-9999 are formatted with leading zeros (e.g., "0042")
   - Numbers ≥10000 use their natural length without padding (e.g., "10000")

3. Added the `format_work_effort_number` method to the `WorkEffortCounter` class to handle formatting based on number size.

4. Added support for date-prefixed numbering:
   - Standard format: `0042_example_name.md`
   - Date-prefixed format: `20250317042_example_name.md`

5. Added a utility function `format_work_effort_filename` for easy filename creation.

6. Updated the demo script to support both naming formats with command-line arguments.

7. Added comprehensive tests:
   - Test large number detection
   - Test formatting of variable-length numbers
   - Test the transition from 9999 to 10000

### Demonstration Results

Created demonstration work efforts in three different formats:

1. Standard Sequential:
   - `0001_sequential_numbering_example.md`
   - `0002_another_sequential_example.md`

2. Date-Prefixed:
   - `202503170001_sequential_numbering_example.md`
   - `202503170002_another_sequential_example.md`

3. Large Numbers (demonstrating 9999 → 10000 transition):
   - `9998_approaching_limit.md`
   - `9999_at_the_limit.md`
   - `10000_beyond_the_limit.md`

## Key Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Work efforts now follow a consistent naming pattern
2. **Scalability**: The system can handle any number of work efforts
3. **Flexibility**: Supports both simple sequential numbering and date-prefixed numbering
4. **Reliability**: Uses robust counter with integrity checks and file locking

## Documentation

Created a separate README_COUNTER.md with detailed documentation of the improved counter system.

## Tasks

- [x] Update regex pattern to support variable-length numbers
- [x] Add support for numbers beyond 9999
- [x] Implement date-prefixed numbering option
- [x] Create testing script for large numbers
- [x] Generate demonstration work efforts
- [x] Document the improved system

## Notes

The improved counter system now provides a future-proof solution that will work for any number of work efforts, whether using standard sequential numbering or date-prefixed naming.
