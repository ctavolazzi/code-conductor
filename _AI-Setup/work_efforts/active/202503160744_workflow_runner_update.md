# Workflow Runner Script Update

## Overview

This update enhances the Workflow Runner Script to properly use the `_AI-Setup/work_efforts/scripts` directory for script creation. The original implementation created scripts in the root directory, but this update ensures all script files are generated in the appropriate directory structure.

## Goals

- Ensure all generated script files are placed in the `_AI-Setup/work_efforts/scripts` directory
- Fix issues with feature name parameter handling in non-interactive mode
- Maintain the consistent workflow process while respecting project directory structure

## Implementation Details

The following changes were made to the workflow runner script:

1. **Added Scripts Directory Constant**
   - Added a new constant `SCRIPTS_DIR = f"{WORK_EFFORTS_DIR}/scripts"`
   - Updated all file path references to use this constant

2. **Fixed Feature Name Handling**
   - Modified the workflow runner to properly use the feature name parameter
   - Ensured the slugified feature name is used in all file paths
   - Fixed the logic to only prompt for feature information if not already provided

3. **Updated Script Path Generation**
   - Changed script path from `f"{self.script_name}.py"` to `os.path.join(SCRIPTS_DIR, f"{self.script_name}.py")`
   - Modified test path similarly to ensure it uses the scripts directory

4. **Improved Feedback**
   - Added output showing where scripts will be created
   - Ensured all file paths displayed to the user show the full path within the project structure

5. **Fixed Template Issues**
   - Fixed template definitions and variable interpolation

## Testing

The script was tested with the following scenarios:

- **Non-interactive mode with feature name**: Successfully created all files in the correct directories with the proper feature name
- **Permission checking**: Confirmed that generated script and test files have executable permissions (755)
- **Content validation**: Verified that generated files correctly include the feature name and related properties

## Benefits

- **Improved Organization**: All script files are now properly organized in the designated scripts directory
- **Consistent Structure**: Follows project conventions for file organization
- **Better Maintenance**: Easier to manage and identify generated scripts
- **Proper Naming**: Files are now correctly named based on the provided feature name

## Conclusion

The Workflow Runner Script now correctly utilizes the `_AI-Setup/work_efforts/scripts` directory for all script file creation, ensuring consistency with the project's organizational structure. This update maintains the automated workflow process while improving file organization and naming consistency.
