## Detailed Process Steps

### 1. Create Work Effort Document

```bash
# Create a timestamped work effort document
touch _AI-Setup/work_efforts/active/$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M")_feature_name.md
```

Each new feature or enhancement begins with a dedicated work effort document. This document serves as the central reference point for all work related to the feature.

**Key Components:**
- Timestamped filename for unique identification
- Frontmatter with title, creation date, priority, and status
- Tags for categorization
- Related efforts links using Obsidian-style `[[document]]` syntax

### 2. Add Context & Requirements

The work effort document should be populated with comprehensive context and requirements before coding begins:

**Required Sections:**
- **Overview**: Brief description of the feature
- **Goals**: Specific outcomes the feature should achieve
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How success will be measured
- **Design Considerations**: Architectural or design patterns to follow

This context-setting phase ensures clarity of purpose before implementation begins.

### 3. Create Script or Code

Develop the implementation following established guidelines:

**Coding Standards:**
- Clear file and variable naming
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints where appropriate
- Error handling
- Consistent code style

For scripts, ensure they:
- Have executable permissions
- Include proper shebang lines
- Support --help for usage instructions
- Implement appropriate command-line arguments

### 4. Execute & Test

Test the implementation with various inputs and scenarios:

**Testing Approaches:**
- Manual testing with representative use cases
- Dry-run modes for potentially destructive operations
- Edge case testing
- Performance testing where relevant

Documentation of test results should include:
- Command used
- Input provided
- Expected output
- Actual output
- Any errors or unexpected behavior

### 5. Document Results

Record detailed results after each execution:

**Result Documentation:**
- Success or failure status
- Observations about performance or behavior
- Screenshots or console output
- Unexpected behaviors or edge cases discovered
- Insights gained during testing

### 6. Refine Until Successful

Iteratively improve the implementation based on test results:

**Refinement Process:**
- Address identified issues or bugs
- Improve error handling
- Optimize performance
- Enhance user experience
- Simplify complex logic

### 7. Add Tests

Create comprehensive automated tests to ensure ongoing reliability:

**Test Types:**
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- System tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests for efficiency benchmarks

Tests should be:
- Automated
- Repeatable
- Independent
- Comprehensive
- Maintainable

### 8. Update All Documentation

Update all relevant documentation with the final implementation details:

**Documentation Locations:**
- Work effort document (primary)
- devlog.md with feature summary
- CHANGELOG.md with version-appropriate entries
- README.md if user-facing features change
- Relevant README files in subdirectories
- In-code documentation and docstrings

### 9. Repeat for Next Feature

Begin the process again for the next feature, linking to relevant previous work efforts where appropriate.

## Documentation Integration

All documentation should follow a connected structure:

1. **Work Effort Documents**: Primary documentation for specific features
2. **Devlog**: Chronological record of development activities
3. **CHANGELOG**: Version-specific changes for release notes
4. **README files**: User-facing documentation

## Version History

- **v0.0.1** (2025-03-16): Initial documentation of workflow process

## Time Management Guidelines

- Spend 20-30% of total feature development time on planning and documentation
- Test continuously rather than only at the end
- Document incrementally as you work rather than all at once
- Review workflow compliance before considering a feature complete

## Conclusion

This workflow emphasizes "documentation-first" development, where the act of documenting becomes an integral part of the development process rather than an afterthought. By following these steps consistently, we ensure that Code Conductor remains well-documented, maintainable, and aligned with its design principles.

The workflow itself is versioned and will evolve over time based on lessons learned and changing project needs.
