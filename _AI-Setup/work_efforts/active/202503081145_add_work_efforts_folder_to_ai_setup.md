# Add work_efforts folder to _AI-Setup

## 🚩 Objectives
- Update AI-Setup to create a "work_efforts" folder inside the _AI-Setup directory
- Ensure all work effort scripts work with the new structure
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing projects
- Improve organization of project files

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Modify setup_files.py to create work_efforts folder in _AI-Setup
- [x] Update work effort scripts to work with the new structure
- [x] Test the new structure with existing projects
- [x] Update documentation to reflect the new structure

## 📝 Notes
- The _AI-Setup/work_efforts should include all subdirectories (templates, active, completed, archived, scripts)
- Implementation now creates work_efforts both at the root level (for backward compatibility) and inside _AI-Setup
- Fixed issue with template not being properly created in _AI-Setup/work_efforts/templates
- Ensured scripts are copied correctly to both root and _AI-Setup work_efforts folders

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Initial implementation had an issue where work_efforts directory wasn't being properly created inside _AI-Setup
- Path construction was incorrect in some places
- Template file was missing in _AI-Setup/work_efforts/templates
- Some scripts were not properly handling the new directory structure

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- Successfully implemented the work_efforts directory inside the _AI-Setup folder
- All scripts now work with both the root-level work_efforts and the one inside _AI-Setup
- Improved organization of project files
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing projects
