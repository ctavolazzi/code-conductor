# Project Restructuring

## 🚩 Objectives
- Implement a more structured project organizational system
- Clean up the project structure from the root directory outward
- Create a consistent, maintainable and scalable directory structure
- Improve code organization by grouping related functionalities
- Reduce redundancy and eliminate duplicate code/files
- Simplify onboarding for new contributors

## 🛠 Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current project structure and identify areas for improvement
- [ ] Define a standardized directory structure
- [ ] Create a directory organization plan
- [ ] Move files to their appropriate locations
- [ ] Update import paths and references
- [ ] Create/update documentation about the new structure
- [ ] Create appropriate __init__.py files for Python package organization
- [ ] Test everything works after reorganization
- [ ] Update any affected documentation

## 📝 Notes
- Current project structure has many scripts at the root level
- Many test files are scattered across the root directory
- Several directories (like test_dir, setup_test, etc.) seem temporary or redundant
- The .AI-Setup directory contains the work_efforts which is well-organized
- Need to be careful to maintain backward compatibility

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Root directory is cluttered with many Python files that should be organized into modules
- Multiple test-related directories and files without clear distinction
- Lack of consistent naming conventions for similar files
- Scripts that share functionality are not grouped together

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- A clean, organized project structure with logical grouping of files
- Clear separation of core functionality, utilities, tests, and documentation
- Better maintainability through proper package organization
- Improved developer experience through intuitive file organization
