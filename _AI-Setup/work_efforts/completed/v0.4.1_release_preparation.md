# v0.4.1 Release Preparation

## 🚩 Objectives
- Ensure all files are updated to reflect v0.4.1 release
- Update version numbers in all relevant files
- Verify release notes are complete and accurate
- Add ability to create default work efforts in current directory

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Update `__init__.py` from v0.4.0 to v0.4.1
- [x] Verify version in `setup.py` (already 0.4.1)
- [x] Verify version in `cli.py` (already 0.4.1)
- [x] Check for any other files that need version updates
- [x] Review release notes for completeness
- [x] Implement default work effort creation in current directory

## 📝 Notes
- This is a bugfix release that primarily fixes command names
- All commands should use `code-conductor` and `cc-worke` instead of previous names
- Updated README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and work_efforts/README.md to use the correct command names
- Added functionality to create default work efforts in the current directory when running `cc-worke` without any flags
- Release notes at `_AI-Setup/release_notes/v0.4.1_Release_Notes.md`

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Version number in `__init__.py` was still showing v0.4.0
- Command name in setup.py was using incorrect names instead of `cc-worke`
- README.md and CHANGELOG.md had references to the old command names
- Default work effort creation was not working in the current directory

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- All version numbers consistently updated to v0.4.1
- All command names consistently updated to use `code-conductor` and `cc-worke`
- Release notes are complete and ready for v0.4.1 release
- Running `cc-worke` without any arguments now creates a default work effort in the current directory
