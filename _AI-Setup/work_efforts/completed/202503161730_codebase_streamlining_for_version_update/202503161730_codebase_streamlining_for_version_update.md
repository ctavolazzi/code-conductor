# Codebase Streamlining for Version Update

## 🚩 Objectives
- Streamline the codebase structure to prepare for a smoother version update
- Fix inconsistencies between package structure and import paths
- Consolidate duplicate utility functions and directories
- Update validation functions with better error handling
- Prepare a clean foundation for the upcoming feature releases

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Create a project structure map to identify inconsistencies
- [x] Fix version inconsistencies across modules
- [x] Address import issues in test files
- [x] Fix edge case handling in WorkEffortManager
- [x] Add validate_title function to CLI module and improve validate_date
- [x] Create tests for validation functions
- [x] Consolidate duplicate directories (utils, creators, providers, templates)
- [x] Clean up redundant files and code
- [x] Create a script to detect unused imports
- [x] Update documentation to reflect changes
- [x] Create a migration guide for developers

## 📝 Notes
- The codebase has evolved organically, leading to a mix of flat imports and package-based imports
- Multiple duplicate directories exist between root and src/code_conductor
- Many validation functions need improved error handling
- Several test failures were caused by inconsistent module paths
- Need to standardize import structure before the major version update
- Consolidated 4 duplicate directories (utils, creators, providers, templates)
- Some tests still need import path updates after consolidation
- Created compatibility modules for the major classes to help tests continue to run
- Fixed work effort structure by moving files to their own folders
- Many tests now pass, but some edge case tests still fail as expected
- Created a script to detect unused imports, which helps identify if unused imports represent missed implementation opportunities or should be deleted
- Created a comprehensive migration guide for developers in docs/development/migration/
- Updated project documentation to reflect the new structure and import conventions
- Added detailed API documentation with usage examples for the new structure

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Import errors due to inconsistent module structure
- Inconsistencies in naming command-line arguments between tests and implementation
- Test failures due to incorrect version references
- Duplicate code between root and package directories causing maintenance issues
- Lack of proper validation for titles, dates, and file paths leading to edge case failures
- After consolidation, some tests still rely on the old import paths
- WorkEffortManager needs additional edge case handling for:
  - Empty titles
  - None titles
  - Extremely long titles (OS path length limits)
  - Special characters in titles
  - Invalid date formats
- Several unused imports found throughout the codebase, requiring analysis to determine if they should be implemented or removed

## ✅ Expected Outcomes
- Clean, well-organized codebase
- All tests passing
- Consistent import structure
- Better error handling for edge cases
- Clear documentation of changes
- Solid foundation for future development
