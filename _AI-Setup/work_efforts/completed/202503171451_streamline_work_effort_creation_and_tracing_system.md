# Streamline Work Effort Creation and Tracing System

## 🚩 Objectives
- ✅ Create a single, clear path for creating work efforts via command line
- ✅ Ensure work efforts are properly stored and indexed for easy discovery
- ✅ Simplify the system to focus on core functionality first
- ✅ Remove duplicated code paths and consolidate functionality
- ✅ Create a clean, predictable interface for work effort management

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Audit current work effort creation code paths (CLI, scripts, etc.)
- [x] Identify the core WorkEffortManager functionality needed for creation
- [x] Create a simplified CLI command that directly uses WorkEffortManager
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Implement robust indexing of created work efforts
- [x] Add tracing capabilities to easily find and resume work efforts
- [x] Ensure seamless integration between CLI and Python API
- [x] Clean up any duplicated code or parallel implementations
- [x] Write clear documentation for the streamlined approach
- [x] Add tests to verify reliable behavior

## 📝 Notes
- The system now has a clean, focused command `cc-new` for creating work efforts
- The command directly uses the WorkEffortManager class as intended
- The solution is properly integrated into the package with entry points
- We've eliminated the duplicate code paths with a single, reliable approach
- The command uses proper error handling and provides clear feedback
- The indexed work efforts are easily discoverable with the `cc-index` command
- The implementation follows the "do one thing well" philosophy
- Tracing capabilities have been implemented in a separate work effort
- All test cases are now passing, ensuring reliable behavior of the cc-new command

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- Multiple code paths for the same functionality
- Importing issues with the WorkEffortManager class
- Inconsistent behavior between different creation methods
- Command-line tools not properly set up in PATH

## ✅ Success Criteria
- ✅ A single `cc-new` command that reliably creates work efforts
- ✅ Proper indexing and tracing for created work efforts
- ✅ Clean documentation for how to use the system
- ✅ All work efforts detectable by the indexing system regardless of location
- ✅ System extensible for future enhancements

## 🔄 Implementation Summary
We created a clean, simple Python script `cc-new` that properly integrates with the existing Code Conductor infrastructure. The script:

1. Provides a focused interface to create work efforts with minimal args: `cc-new "Work Title"`
2. Implements optional switches for all common parameters: `-a/--assignee`, `-p/--priority`, `-d/--due-date`
3. Directly uses the WorkEffortManager class as intended
4. Installs as a proper command via package entry points
5. Handles errors gracefully
6. Provides user-friendly output
7. Follows the Unix philosophy of "do one thing well"

The implementation avoids duplicate functionality, instead focusing on providing a clean interface to the core WorkEffortManager functionality. The existing work effort indexing ensures that all work efforts created with this command are properly trackable.

The tracing capabilities have been implemented in [[202503171700_implement_work_effort_tracing.md]], which adds methods to find related work efforts, trace dependency chains, and track work effort history.

To ensure reliability and maintainability, we've added comprehensive tests for the `cc-new` command in `tests/test_cc_new_command.py`. These tests verify:
1. Basic work effort creation with default parameters
2. Creation with custom options (priority, assignee, etc.)
3. Proper error handling during creation failures
4. Support for custom project locations
5. Correct argument parsing
