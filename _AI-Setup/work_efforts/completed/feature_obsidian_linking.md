# Feature: Obsidian Linking Implementation

## 🚩 Objectives
- Demonstrate semantic/categorical naming convention
- Document pros and cons of this approach
- Serve as an example of category-based naming (feature_xxx)

## 🛠 Tasks
- [x] Create example with semantic naming
- [x] Add to main work effort documentation
- [x] Link with actual obsidian linking implementation

## 📝 Notes
- This convention uses a category prefix followed by a descriptive name
- Examples: feature_xxx, bugfix_xxx, refactor_xxx
- Good for organizing work by type or category
- Provides clear context just from the filename
- This work effort is now properly linked with the implementation work effort [[202503160633_obsidian_style_document_linking]]

## 🐞 Issues Encountered
- None

## ✅ Outcomes & Results
- **Pros:**
  - Immediately communicates work type/category
  - Good for filtering by work type
  - Human-readable and meaningful
  - Works well with project management approaches
  - Easy to verbally reference
- **Cons:**
  - No built-in uniqueness guarantees
  - No timestamp information
  - Requires consistency in naming conventions
  - Limited number of useful categories
  - May become too generic in large projects
