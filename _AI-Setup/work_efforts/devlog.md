### Project Manifest Implementation

**Goal:** Create a project manifest file to improve project root identification and configuration discovery, along with a breadcrumb trail to help navigate complex project structures.

#### Implemented Changes:
1. **Project Manifest File**
   - Added code to create a `.code-conductor` manifest file in the project root during setup
   - The manifest contains essential project information including project root path, version, and setup path
   - This serves as an anchor point for identifying the project root directory

2. **Breadcrumb Trail Implementation**
   - Created a system that generates `.code-conductor-ref` files in each directory where commands are run
   - Each reference file contains a history of commands with timestamps, paths, and other metadata
   - These files create a breadcrumb trail that makes it easy to trace back to the project root

3. **Find-Root Command**
   - Added a new `code-conductor find-root` command that helps users locate their project root from any subdirectory
   - The command displays project information and provides the exact command to navigate back to the root
   - Uses the breadcrumb trail for enhanced location awareness

4. **Enhanced Configuration Discovery**
   - Modified the `find_nearest_config` function to first look for the manifest file
   - Updated the configuration discovery logic to use information from the manifest file
   - Added appropriate error handling for cases where the manifest file might be corrupted or invalid

**Impact:** These implementations significantly improve the reliability of project root identification and navigation, particularly in complex project structures with deeply nested directories. Users can now easily locate the project root from anywhere in their project, and trace the history of commands executed in each directory.
