# Using Code Conductor with Obsidian and Cursor

This guide explains how to set up and use Code Conductor with Obsidian and Cursor to create an optimal development workflow.

## Why Use Obsidian and Cursor?

- **Obsidian**: A knowledge management system that works with local Markdown files, perfect for visualizing and navigating the work efforts and documentation generated by Code Conductor.
- **Cursor**: An AI-powered code editor based on VS Code that enhances your coding experience with advanced AI assistance.
- **Combined**: These tools create a powerful development environment where code and documentation are seamlessly integrated.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Required Software

1. **Install Obsidian**
   - Download from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
   - Install according to your operating system instructions

2. **Install Cursor**
   - Download from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh/)
   - Install according to your operating system instructions

3. **Install Code Conductor**
   - Open Cursor terminal
   - Run: `pip install code-conductor`

### Step 2: Configure Your Project

1. **Set up your project with Code Conductor**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project directory
   cd /path/to/your/project

   # Initialize Code Conductor in your project
   code-conductor setup
   ```

2. **Open your project in Obsidian**
   - Launch Obsidian
   - Click "Open folder as vault"
   - Navigate to and select your project directory
   - Obsidian will now use your project as a vault

3. **Open your project in Cursor**
   - Launch Cursor
   - Select "Open Folder" and choose your project directory

### Step 3: Working with Both Tools

Once your environment is set up:

1. **Use Cursor for:**
   - Coding and development
   - Running Code Conductor commands
   - AI-assisted programming
   - Using the terminal to manage work efforts with Code Conductor commands

2. **Use Obsidian for:**
   - Viewing work efforts and their connections
   - Navigating through documentation
   - Creating new notes that link to work efforts
   - Visualizing the connections between different aspects of your project

## Working with Code Conductor

### Creating Work Efforts

```bash
# Create a new work effort
code-conductor create-work-effort "Feature Implementation"
```

The created work effort will be available in the `_AI-Setup/work_efforts/active` directory and can be viewed in both Cursor and Obsidian.

### Viewing in Obsidian

In Obsidian, you can:

1. Navigate to the `_AI-Setup/work_efforts/active` folder in the file explorer
2. Click on any work effort to view it
3. Use the graph view to visualize connections between work efforts
4. Create new notes that link to existing work efforts using `[[file-name]]` syntax

### Recommended Obsidian Plugins

Consider installing these Obsidian plugins to enhance your workflow:

1. **Graph View**: Visualize connections between notes (built-in)
2. **Backlinks**: View references to the current note (built-in)
3. **Dataview**: Create dynamic content based on your notes' metadata
4. **Templater**: Create templates for different types of notes
5. **Calendar**: View and create notes for specific dates

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Cursor and Obsidian open simultaneously** to seamlessly switch between coding and documentation
2. **Create detailed work efforts** that document what you're working on
3. **Use Obsidian's linking features** to connect related work efforts
4. **Commit both code and work efforts** to version control to maintain a history of your development process
5. **Regularly update work effort statuses** using Code Conductor commands:
   ```bash
   code-conductor update-status "work-effort-title" completed
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Obsidian doesn't show new files**: Refresh the view (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Code Conductor commands not found**: Ensure it's properly installed with `pip list | grep code-conductor`
3. **Linking issues in Obsidian**: Use the full file path in wiki links: `[[_AI-Setup/work_efforts/active/file]]`

By combining Obsidian, Cursor, and Code Conductor, you create a powerful development environment that integrates code, documentation, and knowledge management into a cohesive workflow.
