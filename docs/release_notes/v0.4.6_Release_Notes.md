# Version 0.4.6 Release Notes

Release Date: 2025-03-16

## Overview

This release focuses on significantly improving the user experience by restructuring the project into a proper package layout and enhancing how Code Conductor works with the current directory. These changes make the tool more intuitive and eliminate the need to manually set PYTHONPATH.

## Key Improvements

### Project Structure

- **Restructured project** with a proper `src` directory package layout
- **Fixed import system** to eliminate the need for manually setting PYTHONPATH
- **Updated entry points** to work correctly with the new structure
- **Improved package installation** with development mode support (`pip install -e .`)

### Current Directory (PWD) Handling

- **Enhanced PWD detection** - commands now use your current directory by default
- **Clear messaging** - shows exactly where files are being searched for and created
- **Improved work effort discovery** - better searches up the directory tree
- **Verbose mode control** - use the `-q/--quiet` flag to control output detail

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Better work effort listing** - correctly shows work efforts in subdirectories
- **Enhanced directory structure feedback** - clearly shows file paths
- **Simplified command syntax** - `code-conductor work` instead of `code-conductor work_effort`
- **Non-interactive automation** - `--yes` flag for automated setup in new directories
- **Added support for listing archived work efforts**

## Command Line Changes

- `code-conductor work` - Creates a work effort in your current directory
- `code-conductor list` - Lists all work efforts, including those in subdirectories
- `code-conductor list-managers` - Lists all available work effort managers
- New flags:
  - `-q, --quiet` - Reduces verbosity of directory search output
  - `-y, --yes` - Automatically answers yes to prompts (non-interactive mode)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed work effort listing to properly show work efforts in subdirectories
- Resolved various import path issues that required manual PYTHONPATH setting
- Fixed create_work_effort function reference issues
- Addressed an issue where work efforts were sometimes created in unexpected locations

## Installation and Upgrade

```bash
# New installation
pip install code-conductor

# Upgrade from previous version
pip install --upgrade code-conductor
```

## Compatibility Notes

This release maintains backward compatibility with existing work effort files and directory structures while significantly improving the user experience. No migration is needed for existing work efforts.
