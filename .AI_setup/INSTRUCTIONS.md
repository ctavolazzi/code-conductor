# AI_setup Instructions

This directory contains setup files for AI-assisted development.

## Usage

This setup enables your AI assistants to better understand your project structure
and provide more contextual help and recommendations.

### Commands

The AI_setup package provides the main command:

`cc-ai` - Main command for setting up AI assistance and work efforts
   - `cc-ai help` - Show help information
   - `cc-ai setup` - Set up AI assistance in the current directory
   - `cc-ai work_effort` - Create a new work effort
   - `cc-ai work_effort -i` - Create a new work effort interactively
   - `cc-ai list` - List all work efforts

### Shorthand Commands

For faster usage:
   - `cc-ai wei` - Work effort interactive (same as work_effort -i)
   - `cc-ai we` - Work effort non-interactive (same as work_effort)
   - `cc-ai l` - List work efforts (same as list)
   - `cc-ai s` - Setup (same as setup)

No action is required from you - the AI tools will automatically utilize these files.
