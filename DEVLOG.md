## 2025-03-09: Testing v0.4.1 Package Installation and Creating v0.4.2 Release

### Development Plan
1. Create a new test repository locally
2. Install code-conductor v0.4.1 using pip
3. Test the CLI commands as described in the release notes:
   - `code-conductor setup`
   - `code-conductor work_effort`
   - `code-conductor list`
   - `cc-worke -i`
   - `cc-worke --use-ai --description "Test description"`
   - `cc-worke` (default work effort creation)
4. Document the results of each test
5. Update the work effort with findings
6. Create a v0.4.2 release to fix identified issues

### Progress
- Created work effort for testing v0.4.1 package (202503091240_test_v041_package.md)
- Created a new test repository at ~/test-code-conductor
- Installed code-conductor package (already installed at version 0.4.1)
- Tested the following commands:
  - `code-conductor setup` - SUCCESS
  - `cc-worke` - FAILED (command not found)
  - `cc-work-e` - SUCCESS (this is the correct command name)
  - `cc-work-e -i` - SUCCESS (interactive mode works)
  - `code-conductor work_effort` - SUCCESS
  - `code-conductor list` - SUCCESS
- Created v0.4.2 release to fix command naming consistency
- Updated all documentation to use `cc-work-e` consistently
- Updated version number in setup.py to 0.4.2
- Created new release notes for v0.4.2
- Updated CHANGELOG.md to include v0.4.2 information

### Issues Encountered
- The `cc-worke` command mentioned in the release notes is actually `cc-work-e` (with a hyphen)
- There appears to be a typo in the release notes
- The `cc-work-e` command creates work efforts in `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/ai_setup/work_efforts/` rather than in the current directory as mentioned in the release notes

### Next Steps
- Upload the v0.4.2 release to PyPI
- Verify that the updated package installs correctly
- Monitor user feedback on the fix

### Findings
1. The installed version is confirmed to be 0.4.1
2. The main `code-conductor` commands are working as expected
3. The shorthand `cc-worke` command mentioned in the release notes is actually `cc-work-e` (with a hyphen)
4. All commands work properly after correcting for the typo
5. There's an issue with the work effort location when using the `cc-work-e` command - it's not creating them in the current directory as stated in the release notes
6. The `code-conductor setup` command correctly sets up the AI development environment
7. The `code-conductor work_effort` command creates work efforts in the expected location (current directory)

### Conclusion
The code-conductor v0.4.1 package works as expected with a few minor issues:
1. Typo in the release notes: `cc-worke` should be `cc-work-e`
2. The `cc-work-e` command doesn't create work efforts in the current directory as expected

### v0.4.2 Release Summary
- Fixed the entry point name to use `cc-work-e` consistently
- Updated all documentation to reflect the correct command name
- Made note of the issue with work effort location

## 2025-03-09: Installing Package and Creating Default Work Effort

### Development Plan
1. Install the Code Conductor package locally in development mode
2. Verify the installation was successful by checking the available commands
3. Create a new default work effort using the installed command
4. Verify the work effort was created successfully

### Progress
- Created development plan for package installation and default work effort creation
- Created work effort for the task (202503091212_install_and_create_work_effort.md)
- Successfully installed the package in development mode using `pip install -e .`
- Verified that the commands `code-conductor` and `cc-work-e` are available in the PATH
- Created two work efforts with the cc-work-e command:
  - A default work effort titled "Untitled"
  - A work effort with a custom title "Created from installed package"
- Found that work efforts are created in a default location at `/Users/ctavolazzi/Code/ai_setup/work_efforts/active/`
- Discovered that the code actually does implement `--current-dir` and `--package-dir` flags in the `cc-work-e` command

## 2023-03-10: Complex Edge Case Testing for Work Effort Manager

### Development Plan
1. Study the current Work Effort Manager implementation to identify potential edge cases
2. Create a comprehensive test suite that covers the following areas:
   - Invalid input handling (empty strings, None values, invalid types)
   - File system edge cases (permissions, missing directories, read-only files)
   - Concurrency and race conditions (multiple simultaneous operations)
   - Error handling and recovery (corrupted files, interrupted operations)
   - Performance under stress (large number of work efforts, large file sizes)
   - Internationalization (non-ASCII characters, different encodings)
   - Configuration edge cases (missing config, invalid config values)
3. Implement the tests using pytest with appropriate fixtures
4. Create mock objects and patches to isolate components for testing
5. Document all test cases and expected behavior
6. Update the work effort with results and findings

### Progress
- Created a work effort to track this testing task
- Analyzed the Work Effort Manager implementation
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_work_effort_manager_edge_cases.py`
- Identified several important edge cases that need handling:

### Results and Recommendations
Based on our edge case testing, we've identified the following issues that should be addressed:

1. **Input Validation:**
   - **Empty Titles:** The manager currently accepts empty title strings. It should reject them or provide a default.
   - **None Values:** Calling `.lower()` on a None title causes an AttributeError. Input validation needed.
   - **Invalid Date Formats:** Currently accepted without validation, leading to potential issues later.

2. **File System Handling:**
   - **Special Characters in Titles:** These create invalid filenames. Need to sanitize filenames.
   - **Extremely Long Titles:** Create filenames that exceed OS limits. Need to implement truncation.
   - **Missing Directories:** Some operations assume directories exist without proper checks.

3. **Concurrency and Race Conditions:**
   - Potential for race conditions during simultaneous operations.
   - Need file locking or other synchronization mechanisms.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Improve error handling for file system operations.
   - Provide better recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations.

5. **Internationalization:**
   - Need proper handling of Unicode characters in filenames and content.

These findings will help make the Work Effort Manager more robust and reliable by ensuring it gracefully handles edge cases and unexpected inputs.

## 2025-03-09: Implementing Centralized Version Management

### Development Plan
1. Analyze current version references across the codebase
2. Create a work effort to track the version consistency updates
