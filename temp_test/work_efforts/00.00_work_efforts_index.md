- **active** - Currently being worked on
- **paused** - Temporarily on hold
- **completed** - Finished successfully
- **cancelled** - Abandoned or no longer needed

## Essential Directories
- [[templates/|Templates]] - Work effort templates
- [[archived/|Archived Work Efforts]] - Permanently archived work efforts
- [[scripts/|Scripts]] - Helper scripts for managing work efforts

## Commands
Create a new work effort: `cc-ai we -i`
List all work efforts: `cc-ai l`
Quick setup: `cc-ai s`

## External References

- [[../devlog/devlog.md|Development Log]] - Current development activities

## Johnny Decimal System Guide
The Johnny Decimal system organizes information using a hierarchical numbering system:
- **00-99**: Major categories (e.g., 00 System, 10 Development)
- **00.00-00.99**: Individual documents within each category
- **00.00**: Always the index file for each category

Status is managed in each document's frontmatter rather than separate folder structures.
